    <h2>Information We Collect From You</h2>
    <p> While extensive professional information will be collected as needed to

    <h2>How Information is Used</h2>
    <p>
        anushram does not use volunteered information in any way other than forwarding it to partner institutions and 
        corporate entities so that they may take a decision on the suitability of the candidate. 
        anushram is not responsible for any way the partner institutions and corporate entities 
        choose to use your information.
